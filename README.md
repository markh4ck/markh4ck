## 🔬 Academic & Research Work

I maintain a strong interest in **academic research and experimental engineering**, particularly at the intersection of **computer security**, **low-level systems**, and **quantitative finance**.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis  
- Operating systems internals and low-level computing  
- Program analysis and exploit development  
- Applied cryptography and protocol security  
- Quantitative finance, market microstructure, and DeFi mechanisms  

### 📚 Selected Academic & Technical Projects
- **Binary Analysis & Reverse Engineering Labs**  
  Practical research on ELF/PE binaries, obfuscation techniques, anti-debugging methods, and exploit primitives.

- **Low-Level Systems Experiments**  
  Kernel-level projects, bootloaders, memory management, and OS internals implemented in C and Assembly.

- **Security Research & Proofs of Concept**  
  Vulnerability research, exploit PoCs, and security analysis of real-world software and protocols.

- **Quantitative Finance & DeFi Research**  
  Market modeling, algorithmic trading strategies, and decentralized finance protocol design through **Siprifi**.

> Some projects are open-source and available on GitHub, while others remain private or unpublished due to research or security constraints.
