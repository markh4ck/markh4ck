# 👋 Hi, I'm Marc Aliaga

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries between **technology**, **quantitative finance**, and **low-level computing**. Whether it's diving deep into the internals of an operating system, exploring algorithmic trading strategies, or building educational content—I thrive at the intersection of precision and performance.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 Independent researcher focused on **quantitative finance** and **low-level computer systems**.
- 🔧 Strong interest in systems programming, reverse engineering, and compiler theory.
- 📈 Fascinated by the mathematics of markets, stochastic processes, and high-frequency trading infrastructure.
- 🌐 Content creator in both English and Spanish across two distinct channels.
